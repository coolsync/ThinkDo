 three collections that are used very often in Rust programs:

- A *vector* allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.
- A *string* is a collection of characters. We’ve mentioned the `String` type previously, but in this chapter we’ll talk about it in depth.
- A *hash map* allows you to associate a value with a particular key. It’s a particular implementation of the more general data structure called a *map*.
